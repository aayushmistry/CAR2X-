Car2x or Car-to-x basically stands for technologies with which vehicles (cars, trucks, etc.) exchange information in real time. Vehicles send out standardised information, e.g. about speed, GPS, location, etc. <br>
The traffic infrastructure also sends out data, e.g. a traffic jam warning, accident warning, information on alternative routes, detours and much more.<br>

__subcriber_delay__ - This is a Python script developed for analyzing and logging V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) and E2E (End-to-End) communication delays in a ROS environment. The script subscribes to relevant ROS topics, extracts essential data, and calculates delays, providing valuable insights into the performance of communication systems.<br>
__post_processing__ - This file is a Python script designed for analyzing and visualizing delay data from a CSV file. Leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy, this tool provides insightful statistics and graphical representations related to communication delays in a given dataset.<br>
__Probability_Density_Function__ - In this image the upper graph represents probability density function (PDF) for the delay of V2X (vehicle-to-everything) messages and lower graph represents probability density function for the delay of E2E (End To End) messages.<br>
__Distance_vs_Delay__ - In this image the upper scatter plot represents the relationship between V2X delay and distance, while the lower scatter plot represents the relationship between E2E delay and distance.<br>
__Avg.Distance_vs_Delay__ - In this image the upper bar graph represents the relationship between V2X delay and distance at interval of 50 meters, while the lower bar graph represents the relationship between E2E delay and distance at interval of 50 meters.<br>
