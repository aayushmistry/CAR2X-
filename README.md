Car2x or Car-to-x basically stands for technologies with which vehicles (cars, trucks, etc.) exchange information in real time. Vehicles send out standardised information, e.g. about speed, GPS, location, etc. <br>
The traffic infrastructure also sends out data, e.g. a traffic jam warning, accident warning, information on alternative routes, detours and much more.<br>
